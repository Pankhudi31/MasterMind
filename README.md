# MasterMind
It is a game.<br />
Mastermind is an old code-breaking game played by two players. <br />
The game goes back to the 19th century and can be played with paper and pencil.<br />
Rules of the game<br/>
Two players play the game against each other; letâ€™s assume Player 1 and Player 2.<br />

Player 1 plays first by setting a multi-digit number.<br />
Player 2 now tries his first attempt at guessing the number.<br />
If Player 2 succeeds in his first attempt (despite odds which are highly unlikely) he wins the game and is crowned Mastermind! If not, then Player 1 hints by revealing which digits or numbers Player 2 got correct.<br />
The game continues till Player 2 eventually is able to guess the number entirely.<br />
Now, Player 2 gets to set the number and Player 1 plays the part of guessing the number.<br />
If Player 1 is able to guess the number within a lesser number of tries than Player 2 took, then Player 1 wins the game and is crowned Mastermind.<br />
If not, then Player 2 wins the game.<br />
The real game, however, has proved aesthetics since the numbers are represented by color-coded buttons.<br />
